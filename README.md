# 📘 LexiLog

LexiLog is a personal vocabulary tracker that helps users save new words, fetch their definitions, take notes, and monitor their familiarity with each word over time. Built as a final project for HCDE 438, it emphasizes user-centered design and modern development practices.

## ✨ Project Overview and Purpose

Many people encounter new words but forget them soon after. LexiLog helps users build and retain their vocabulary by:

- Searching for word definitions via the DictionaryAPI
- Saving words along with notes and familiarity tags
- Tracking how many times they’ve used each word
- Filtering and sorting words based on their familiarity

It’s built with React, styled using Tailwind CSS, and stores data in Firebase Firestore for real-time access and updates.
